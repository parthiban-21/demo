 1. Primitive Data Types & Default Values:
 	Int - 0
 	Char - null
 	Float - 0.0
 	Double - 0.0
 	Short - 0
 	Long - 0
 	Boolean - Fales
 	Byte - 0

 2. Interface:
  	Interface is where the undefined methods are declared. 
	Yes, Its is Possible to implement more than one interface in one class.
  	
 3. Difference Between Interface and Abstract Class:
 	
 	In Abstract Class, this may have both fully defined method and Incomplete methods.
 but the undefined methods must have the keyword "abstract". And in the Abstract Class, methods have its own definitions.
 
 	In Interface, Only the methods are declared and not defined. This Interface must be implemented to class to define the methods declared in interface.

 4. Types of Polymorphism:
 	i) Overloading
 	ii) Overrinding
 	
 5. Main Features of OOP's:
 	Object Oriented Programming features are listed below,
 	-Inheritance
 	-Polymorphism
 	-Encapsulation
 	-Interface
 	-Abstract
 	
 6. Objects:
 	Objects are used to access methods and variables from other classes.
 	
 7. Inheritance:
 	By Using inheritance, we can use or override the methods and variables of the Parent Class.
 	Its is achieved by using the Keyword "extend".
 	Class to another class and Interface to another interface can be Inherited, But Class to Interface cannot be Inherited.
 	
 8. Constructor:
 	Methods with Same name as the Class Name is Called as Constructor.
 	Constructor are used to Initialize the Values.
 	
 	Types of Constructor:
 	i) Parameterized Constructor
 	ii Non-Parameterized Constructor.
 
 9. Steps to Connect JDBC:
 	- Create the Database with name and Password.
 	- Import Connection Class form Java.sql
 	- Use Class.forName() method to connect JDBC. This differs for different Database.
 	- Use DriverManager method to connect to database. By Passing Database name and Password.
 
 10.Maven Project:
 	With help of maven, we don't need to update versions manually, it updated automatically.
 	We just want to change the dependency with our requirements in the pom.xml
 	It is more helpful when the codes or project need to be shared.
 	
 11.Exceptions:
 	Checked Exception:
 		This is Run Time Error.
 	UnChecked Exception:
 		This is Compile Time Error.
 
 12."This" and "Super" Keywords:
 	This:
 	this keyword is used to use the current value of the variable or method.
 	
 	Super:
 	this keyword is used to access the methods or variable of the parent class from the child class.
 
 13.Nameing Convention:
 	Class - Upper Camel Case & must be same as filename
 	Interface - Upper Camel Case
 	Method - Lower Camel Case
 	Variable - Lower Camel Case
 	Package - Small Alphabetic & Must not start with numeric
 	
 14.List:
 	List is a Collection of Objects. Few lists are ArrayList, PriorityQueue, LinkedList.
 	Allows duplicate values.
 	
 	Set:
 	Set does not allow duplicated values.
 	
 	Map:
 	Map does not allow duplicate values for key value.
 	
 15.Generic:
 	Generic is a concept of passing a class to a Collection.
 	Eg : ArrayList<Integer> - this array list can have only integer type data.
 		 ArrayList<ClassName> - this array list has the datatype of the class.
